# Weather TV 
A fictional cable weather channel web app that I thought about one night while flipping through channels. I saw a design on the Weather Channel and thought I'd like to try building that in CSS.

## Technologies used:
* [React 16](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Ducks Pattern](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be)
* [Redux Actions](https://redux-actions.js.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [Weather Bit api](https://www.weatherbit.io/)
* [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

## Challenges 
* Open Weather data is a little more work to get what I wanted so I switched to Weather Bit, which actually has Swagger docs so you can test different calls from within swagger. Also able to set the number of days to 5 which is exactly what I wanted.
